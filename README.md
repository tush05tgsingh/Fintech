Projects related to fintech and my personality ! 

### a workflow should look like :

- **Collect data** (price, fundamentals, alternative, macro, order book).
- **Clean & align** (handle missing data, adjust for corporate actions).
- **Feature engineering** (technical indicators, sentiment, macro scores).
- **Model selection** (time series, NLP, RL).
- **Backtesting** with realistic assumptions.
- **Deploy** with risk controls.
- **Monitor** and retrain to adapt to market changes.
