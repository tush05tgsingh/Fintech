It takes the `average` of a stock's closing price over a specific number of days.- *Why is it useful?* The SMA helps to smooth out price data, making it easier to see the overall trend. A short-term SMA (like the 10-day) reacts quickly to price changes, while a long-term SMA (like the 50-day) is much slower and shows the bigger picture. When a short-term SMA crosses above a long-term SMA, it's often seen as a bullish signal (a sign of a rising trend), and a cross below is a bearish signal (a sign of a falling trend). By including these as features, our model can learn these trend-following patterns.")

If autocorrelations shift, yesterday's pattern doesn't help predict tomorrow. So predictions become misleading. The ADF test helps us check stationarity. The null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) is that the series is non-stationary. The alternative (H‚ÇÅ) is that the series is stationary. If the p-value is below a threshold (like 0.05), we reject H‚ÇÄ and conclude the series is stationary. If above, we fail to reject H‚ÇÄ, suggesting non-stationarity.")

If the autocorrelation drops off quickly, it suggests that past values have less influence on future values, indicating a more random series. If the autocorrelation remains high for many lags, it suggests that past values strongly influence future values, indicating a more predictable series. In stock prices, we often see weak autocorrelation, meaning past prices don't strongly predict future prices. However, in stock returns (percentage changes), we might see stronger autocorrelation, especially over short lags. This can be useful for short-term trading strategies.")
